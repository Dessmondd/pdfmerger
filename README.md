# PDF Merger.py

Basic PDF Merger that does not require any internet connection or use any third party website for it to work.

Main reasons of why i made this:
- Don't wanna upload certain files to merging websites because most of them keep your files for long periods of time
- I wanna automatize my tasks, so i just wanna include this also inside a .sh script whenever i have to merge different documentation.
- Light weight fast and simple.

More versions to come, and probably a bit more polished but for now it does the job.

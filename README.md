# PDF Merger.py

Basic PDF Merger that does not require any internet connection or use any third party website for it to work.

Main reasons of why i made this:
- Don't wanna upload certain files to merging websites because most of them keep your files for long periods of time.
- I wanna automatize my tasks, so i just wanna include this also inside a .sh script whenever i have to merge different documentation.
- Light weight fast and simple.

More versions to come, and probably a bit more polished but for now it does the job.

How to use it:
- Give the program the path where the pdfs you wanna merge are.
- Select the pdfs(each of pdf will be numerated with a number) by typing the number of the ones you wanna merge.
- Give the pdf a new name.
- Enjoy!
